# Installation

Acme PHP is available as a single PHAR file to download on Github. For security purposes,
this PHAR file is signed using OpenSSL to ensure you are using a valid Acme PHP binary.

You can install it by running the following commands:

``` bash
cd ~
php -r "copy('https://github.com/acmephp/acmephp/releases/download/1.0.0-beta4/acmephp.phar', 'acmephp.phar');"
php -r "copy('https://github.com/acmephp/acmephp/releases/download/1.0.0-beta4/acmephp.phar.pubkey', 'acmephp.phar.pubkey');"
php acmephp.phar --version
```

If the last command display the Acme PHP version, you are ready to use Acme PHP.

## Use the latest development version

While we strongly recommand you to use a stable (or at least pre-release) version, you can also use the latest
development build if you need the latest features.

You can install it by running the following commands:

``` bash
cd ~
php -r "copy('https://acmephp.github.io/downloads/acmephp.phar', 'acmephp.phar');"
php -r "copy('https://acmephp.github.io/downloads/acmephp.phar.pubkey', 'acmephp.phar.pubkey');"
php acmephp.phar --version
```
